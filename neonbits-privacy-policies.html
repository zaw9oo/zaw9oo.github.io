I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        
        
        <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
        
        
        
        <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to Firebase Authentication. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        
        
        
        <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device’s internal memory.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.</p>
        
        
        
        <h3>Service Providers</h3>
        
        
        
        <p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
        
        
        
        <p>To facilitate our Service;<br>
        To provide the Service on our behalf;<br>
        To perform Service-related services; or<br>
        To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.<br>
        I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>
        
        
        
        <h3>Security</h3>
        
        
        
        <p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        
        
        
        <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
        
        
        
        <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites.
